# Udacity_DSND_Blog_Post
This is the first project in the Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree.

This project consists of a simple data analysis of the 2020/21 English premier League, and here I used data that I got from a Kaggle repository, which you can find in this link here, https://www.kaggle.com/rajatrc1705/english-premier-league202021

For this project I just used a Jupyter notebook and the most comon libraries for data analysis, which are numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn, along of course, with Python 3.

Motivation:
As said, this project was made in order to complete the udacity's Data scientist nanodegree project number 1, which consists in writting a blog post, which you can read in the links provided in the main repository.
The analysis consists of a dataset that has the summary for all the players that played at least, one game in the Premier League this season (2020/21), and we have information about the club, the nationality, the position, the age, the number of matches played and more for each player.

My goal here was to understand how can we measure both success and failure in terms of colectivenes and individuality, as we know that club's ambitions vary from club to club, as well as players' ambitions.

I just had to make a few changes in the dataset, since the data was almost clean, and the majority of the work was really into analysing the data and trying to get some insights from it.

The Repository:

This repository has two arquives, and they represent the following:
- Premier_League_Players_analysis.ipynb - which is the Jupyter notebook that has all the analysis and transformations in the data;
- EPL_20_21.csv - which is the dataset that I've downloaded from the link provided in the begining of this file.

Summary of the analysis:

By analysing this dataset I found some comom knowledges and some interesting news, for example, it's clear that the majority of the players are less or even not influential at all for their clubs, and here I could see that only almost 25% of all the players scored at least one goal in the competition. Another interesting factor is that, although some clubs permormed really bad throughout the competition, I could see some players that performed really well, even though their individual sucess doesn't mean that much for the club in the competition.

This analysis can also be an indication of which players from less famous clubs should be bought by the so called big-six England clubs, as when a player from a small team performs really well, this can be an indication that the player in question should be playing for another most prestigious and ambitious club.
